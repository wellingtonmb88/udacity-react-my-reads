# udacity-react-my-reads

## Project overview
In the MyReads project, I created a bookcase application that allows you to select and sort books you've read, are reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library, which use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## TL;DR

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the app server with `npm start`
* run the tests: `npm run test`
